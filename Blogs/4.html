  India began administration of COVID-19 vaccines on 16 January 2021. As of 24 May 2021, India has administered 200,662,456 doses overall, including first and second doses of the currently-approved vaccines.

<br><br>

  Two vaccines received approval for emergency use in India at the onset of the programme, i.e.,
  <br><br>
  i) Covishield (a brand of the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine manufactured by the Serum Institute of India) and
  <br><br>
  ii) Covaxin (developed by Bharat Biotech). In April 2021, Sputnik V (distributed by Dr. Reddy's Laboratories) was approved as a third vaccine, which was deployed by May 2021.

  <br><br>
  <br><br>
 <h2>Launch of vaccination program</h2>
<br><br>
  In September 2020, India's science minister Harsh Vardhan stated that the country planned to approve and begin distribution of a vaccine by the first quarter of 2021. The first recipients were to be 30 million health workers directly dealing with COVID patients.
<br><br>


  On 1 January 2021, the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) approved emergency usage of the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine, which was being manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII) under the trade name "Covishield". On 2 January, the DCGI approved Bharat Biotech's Covaxin for emergency use, even though it had not yet completed phase 3 trials.
<br><br>


  India began its vaccination program on 16 January 2021, operating 3,006 vaccination centres on the onset.Each vaccination centre will offer either Covishield or Covaxin, but not both. Some states have decided to primarily use Covishield, and keep their Covaxin doses as a "buffer stock". Since Covaxin has not completed phase-3 trials, those receiving it will need to sign a consent form.

<br><br>

  165,714 people were vaccinated on the first day of availability. Difficulties in uploading beneficiary lists at some sites caused delays. In the first three days, 631,417 people were vaccinated. Of these, 0.18% reported side-effects and nine people (0.002%) were admitted to hospitals for observation and treatment.Within those first days, there was concerns about low turnout, due to a combination of vaccine safety concerns, technical problems with the software used, and misinformation


<br><br>
  The first phase of the rollout involved health workers and frontline workers including police, paramilitary forces, sanitation workers, and disaster management volunteers. By 1 March, only 14 million healthcare and frontline workers had been vaccinated, falling short of the original goal of 30 million.
